# AMZN Mini E-Commerce Project (Jira + Confluence + GitHub Showcase)

This is a simulated Agile project for an e-commerce platform named **AMZN**, inspired by Amazon. The goal was to build a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product) followed by additional feature expansion. The project was executed using **Scrum methodology** over **2 sprints (2 weeks each)** and tracked using **Jira**, with documentation in **Confluence**.

## Epics & User Stories

### Epic 1: Website Development (Core)
- AZ-5: As a user, I want to browse products by categories.

## Dummy Payment Logic

To simulate the checkout process, a **dummy payment gateway** was used. Users can enter any valid-looking card number (e.g., `4111 1111 1111 1111`) and receive an **Order Confirmation** message.

- No real transactions were processed.
- Bug Encountered: AMEX BIN range (`34xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`) was initially blocked.
- Bug was fixed in Sprint 2.
